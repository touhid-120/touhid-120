# 👋 I’m Tawhid — Strategic Content Architect for the Disruptive Class

You don’t need *just another writer* — you need a mind engineered for **impact, psychology, and influence**. I write content that doesn't just inform... it converts, it scales, it dominates.

## 🔥 What I Do

I help founders, VCs, and growth-stage brands across 5 high-leverage verticals turn their *vision into velocity*:

Every word I write is rooted in data, crafted with story, and deployed for ROI.
